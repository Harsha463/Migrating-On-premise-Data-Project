# Migrating On-premise Data to AWS Data warehouse by ETL Process
This project through an ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) process, that involves moving data
from a on-premises database to a cloud-based data warehouse. The data migration process involves several stages, including:

    1. Data profiling: This involves analyzing the data in the source database to identify the data types, formats, and other characteristics that need to be 
       considered during the migration process.

    2. Data mapping: This involves identifying the source and target data models and mapping the data elements from the source database to the appropriate fields 
       in the target data warehouse.

    3. Data transformation: This involves cleaning and transforming the data as necessary to ensure that it is consistent with the target data model.

    4. Data loading: This involves moving the transformed data from the source database to the target data warehouse using an ETL process.

The project requires expertise in AWS services, ETL tools, and database technologies. It may involve creating AWS infrastructure such as a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), 
creating a database schema in the target data warehouse, configuring ETL jobs, and managing data migration.

Overall, the project can provide significant benefits to organizations, including increased scalability, cost-efficiency, improved data processing speed, and 
enhanced data analytics capabilities. However, it also requires careful planning, testing, and management to ensure that the data migration process is successful 
and that the target data warehouse is properly configured to meet the organization's needs.
